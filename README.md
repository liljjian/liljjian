I'm RJ from Dr. Filemon C. Aguilar Memorial College of Las Piñas, I talk about design and web development! I enjoy working with individuals and assisting them in discovering their passion for technology and web development. I am a Graphic Designer and Creative Director at TS who appreciates UX/UI design and strives to create strong community interactions while advocating open-source technologies.
